# Mask Wearing

Let P = The probability that someone wears a Mask
Let E_OUT = The probability of OUTGOING infection with mask (prob that viral particles escape)
Let E_IN = The probability of INCOMING infection with mask (prob that viral particles make it in)

Possible encounters:
    NO MASK ---> NO MASK | Probability of Occurence = (1-P)^2 | Relative Infection Chance = 1
    MASK ---> NO MASK | Probability of Occurence = P(1-P) | Relative Infection Chance = E_OUT*1 
    NO MASK ---> MASK | Probability of Occurence = P(1-P) | Relative Infection Chance = 1*E_IN
    MASK ---> MASK | Probability of Occurence = P^2 | Relative Infection Chance = E_IN*E_OUT

    => Average relative chance of infection = Sum of each case's infection chance * the probability of that case occurring

    => Reduction in infectivity = 1 - Average relative chance of infection

Therefore, Relative chance of infection with masks = 1*(1-MW_C)^2 + (E_OUT*1*)*MW_C*(1-MW_C) + (1*E_IN)*MW_C*(1-MW_C) + E_IN*E_OUT*MW_C^2

# Vaccinations

- Delay until vaccine is produced (no change until t = release date)
- Distributation rate (dV/dt % gets vaxxed per day)
- Vaccine efficacy % Factor into the B

Let V(t) = The number of people vaccinated (%)
Let P = The probability that someone is vaccinated => V(t) / S
Let E = The probability you get infected (and therefore infect) while vaccinated

Possible encounters
    No Vax --> No Vax | Probability of Occurence = (1-P)^2 | Relative Infection Chance = 1
    Vax --> No Vax | Probability of Occurence = P*(1-P) | Relative Infection Chance = E*1
    No Vax --> Vax | Probability of Occurence = (1-P)*P | Relative Infection Chance = 1*E
    Vax --> Vax | Probability of Occurence = P^2 | Relative Infection Chance = E^2

    Therefore, Relative chance of infection with vaccines = (1-P)^2 + 2*P*(1-P)*E + P^2*E^2
